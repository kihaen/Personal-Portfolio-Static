# React Personal Portfolio

![logo](https://github.com/kihaen/personalPortfolio/blob/master/Resume_Screen.png)

This is my personal website built using a template
### <a href="https://www.kihaen.com">LIVE DEMO</a> 

## Description

I built this site rapidly using a web template provided from StyleShout, for the purpose of developing a portfolio.
Data is populated directly from a JSON file, which allowed changes to be service from a seperate API hosted on AWS.
The entire website is dynamically populated based on the data provided from my API allowing changes to be made rapidly and instantaneously. 

gh-pages was used build and deploy.

This application was built on top of Create-React-App and is hosted statically on github.
